// Here we can add different supporting score systems.
// The score goes in, and stores it in its own administrative system, and can render a page to display it.

// Some of the features handled by a score system:

// store score in a form in own administration
// Display that administration on a score page.

// Ranking can be determined from the score system.
// It could be based in points, time since opening, answering speed, teams or a combination.
